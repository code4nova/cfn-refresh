<h1>Code for NOVA Vision, Mission, and Values</h1>

<main>
<h2>Vision</h2>
<span class="tagline">The world as we'd like to see it</span>
<p>
Government can work for the people, by the people in the digital age.
</p><p>
Services can be simple, accessible, and easy to use. Outcomes can be measurably
better. Better can cost less. We can serve everyone with respect and dignity.
</p><p>
It would be the biggest source of societal good for a generation. Let's all
build it together.
</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<span class="tagline">How we intend to make our vision real</span>
<p>
Code for NOVA uses the principles and practices of the digital age to improve
how government serves the American public, and how the public improves
government.
</p><p>
<span class="countem">1- To inspire change</span> To inspire public servants,
people from the tech sector, and community organizers to create change by
proving government can do better and showing others how.
</p><p>
<span class="countem">2- To make change real</span> Providing government with
access to the resources and digital talent they need so that together we can
meaningfully impact some of the world's toughest societal challenges.
</p><p>
<span class="countem">3- To make change stick</span> Connecting and convening
people from inside and outside government, and from all over the world to
inspire each other, share success, learn, build, and shape a new culture of
public service for the 21st century.
</p><p>
To do it all at scale, serving those who need it most.
</p>

<h2>Our Values</h2>
<span class="tagline">What we are like as an organization</span>
<p>
<span class="countem">1- Empathy is our operating system.</span> We have a deep
empathy for the people we work with. We seek to understand the problems they
face and we work tirelessly to serve them.
</p><p>
<span class="countem">2- No one is coming. It's up to us.</span> We don't wait
for the powers that be to ask us; we act. We don't ask for permission; we find
a way. We don't talk change; we deliver it.
</p><p>
<span class="countem">3- Build the movement</span> No one organization can
fulfill this vision; we will succeed through a movement that invites everyone
to roll up their sleeves and do their part. In short, cultivate the karass.
</p>

<h2>Our Operating Principles</h2>
<span class="tagline">The ideas that guide the decisions we make</span>
<p>
<span class="sayit">Solve real problems.</span> We solve problems that real
people have, we make sure what we build works for them, and we continuously
improve it. We solve real problems instead of creating elegant code and robust
systems to solve imagined ones.
</p><p>
<span class="sayit">Work with, not for</span> the people we serve. We start
with our users, the people affected by the service, and understand and respect
their needs throughout the process. We also respect and support public
servants, and when we are critical of government outcomes, we blame the system,
not the people.<sup>*</sup>
</p><p>
<span class="sayit">We build up</span>, from the user to the system, and from
the local to the federal.
</p><p>
<span class="sayit">Work lean, iterate quickly.</span> Get a working
minimum viable product (MVP) in front of users as early as possible and make
continuous improvements based on how they use the service.
</p><p>
<span class="sayit">Make it better with data.</span> Inform iterations with
data about user behavior. Evaluate programs based on statistically-sound
ground-truthed data about outcomes.
</p><p>
<span class="sayit">Default to open.</span> Work in the open and collaborate
with the community to help make programs and services better for everyone.
</p><p>
<span class="sayit">Impact not ideology.</span> Government that works for all
people doesn't belong to one party or ideology. We welcome all political and
social views that respect the principle that government should work effectively
for all Americans with respect and dignity.
</p><p>
<span class="sayit">Shape the market, don't capture the market.</span>
Government that works for all requires the vendor ecosystem to change to
become more responsive to user needs. We have the potential to create the
biggest change when our project seek to shape, rather than capture, the
market for government technology.
</p><p>
<span class="sayit">Non-partisan, but not neutral.</span> We are an alliance
of non-partisan groups, but that non-partisanship does not imply neutrality.
This community has a vision for what government should be and will work to
bring that vision into reality.
