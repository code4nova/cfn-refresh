<h2>Vision</h2>
<span class="tagline">The world as we'd like to see it</span>
<p>
Government can work for the people, by the people in the digital age.
</p><p>
Services can be simple, accessible, and easy to use. Outcomes can be measurably
better. Better can cost less. We can serve everyone with respect and dignity.
</p><p>
It would be the biggest source of societal good for a generation. Let's all
build it together.
</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<span class="tagline">How we intend to make our vision real</span>
<p>
Code for NOVA uses the principles and practices of the digital age to improve
how government serves the American public, and how the public improves
government.
</p><p>
<span class="countem">1- To inspire change</span> To inspire public servants,
people from the tech sector, and community organizers to create change by
proving government can do better and showing others how.
</p><p>
<span class="countem">2- To make change real</span> Providing government with
access to the resources and digital talent they need so that together we can
meaningfully impact some of the world's toughest societal challenges.
</p><p>
<span class="countem">3- To make change stick</span> Connecting and convening
people from inside and outside government, and from all over the world to
inspire each other, share success, learn, build, and shape a new culture of
public service for the 21st century.
</p><p>
To do it all at scale, serving those who need it most.
